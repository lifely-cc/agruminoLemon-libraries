paragraph=This library contains a complete driver for the PCA9536 exposing all its functionality so that its 4 channels (or IO pins) can be controlled as a single unit or individually in terms of their Mode (INPUT /OUTPUT) and Polarity (NON-INVERTED / INVERTED). The pins' states (LOW / HIGH) can be read (in INPUT mode) or written (in OUTPUT mode).
