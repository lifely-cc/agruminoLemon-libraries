The MCP3221 is a 12-Bit Single-Channel ADC with hardware I2C interface.

This library contains a complete driver for the MCP3221 exposing all its available features. The library also contains configurable functions for obtaining either data or voltage reading from the device, as well as applying smoothing methods (Rolling-Average / Exponential-Moving-Average) to the said data/voltage readings. In addition, the library offers a built-in mechanism for calculating input from either 5V or 12V sources (the latter requiring a hardware voltage divider as the AIN pin of the MCP3221 cannot take more than 5.5V).

## HOOK-UP
* __PIN 1 (VCC/VREF)__ - Serves asimultaniously as Power Supply input and Voltage Reference for the ADC. Connect 5V output of Arduino's' or other equivalent power source (5.5V max). However, if using external power source, remember to connect all GND's together.
* __PIN 2 (GND)__ - Connect to Arduino GND
* __PIN 3 (VIN)__ - Connect input voltage to be measured (RANGE: GND - VCC, Min: 0V, Max: 5.5V). For higher voltage readings (e.g. Min: 8.444V, Max: 12.881V), use a voltage divider (Resistor 1: 10K; Resisor 2: 4K7)
* __PIN 4 (SDA)__ - Connect to Arduino's PIN A4 with a 2K2 (400MHz I2C Bus speed) or 10K (100MHz I2C Bus speed) pull-up resistor
* __PIN 5 (SCL)__ - Connect to Arduino's PIN A5 with a 2K2 (400MHz I2C Bus speed) or 10K (100MHz I2C Bus speed) pull-up resistor
* __DECOUPING__: Minimal decoupling consists of a 0.1uF Ceramic Capacitor between the VCC & GND PINS. For improved performance, add a 1uF and a 10uF Ceramic Capacitors as well across these pins.

## GENERAL NOTES

1) __I2C Communications Library Dependency__

This library depends on the Arduino IDE's native [Wire](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/tree/master/hardware/arduino/avr/libraries/Wire) library for I2C communication between the Arduino (Master) and the MCP3221 (Slave). 

2) __Device Information String__

It possible to extend the MCP3221 Library to include a function for generating a pritable device information string showing all the relevant details about the devices current Configuration, Limit & Hysteresis settings. As the additional functionality comes at the cost of increased memory footprint, it was implemented as an optional add-on rather than added directly to the core MCP3221 Library. See the [MCP3221_Info](https://github.com/nadavmatalon/MCP3221/blob/master/examples/MCP3221_Info/MCP3221_Info.ino) example sketch for detailed explanation and an actual usage demo.

3) __Device I2C Communications String__

It is also possible to extend the MCP3221 Library to include a function for generating a pritable I2C Communications string showing the result of each I2C transaction in a human-friendly way, something that may be useful, for example, during debugging sessions. As the additional functionality comes at the cost of increased memory footprint, it was implemented as an optional add-on rather than added directly to the core MCP3221 Library. See the [MCP3221_I2C_Status](https://github.com/nadavmatalon/MCP3221/blob/master/examples/MCP3221_I2C_Status/MCP3221_I2C_Status.ino) example sketch for detailed explanation and an actual usage demo.

## I2C ADDRESSES

Each MCP3221 has 1 of 8 possible I2C addresses (factory hardwired & recognized by its specific part number & top marking on the package itself):

|PART NO.         | BIN      | HEX  | DEC | MARKING |
|-----------------|----------|------|-----|---------|
| MCP3221A0T-E/OT | 01001000 | 0x48 | 72  | GE      |

## LIBRARY INSTALLATION & SETUP

Begin by installing the library either by using the Arduino IDE's Installation Wizard (Arduino Version >1.5) or simply download the library's ZIP folder from GITHUB, extract it, and copy the extraxcted folder to your Arduino 'libraries' folder.

Next, include the library at the top of the sketch as follows:

```
#include "MCP3221.h"
```

At this point you can construct a new MPC3221 instance(s) by using the following command (at the top of the sketch after the 'include' line):

```
MPC3221 device_name(device_address);
```

>Replace '__device_name__' with a name of your choice. Also, remember to replace  '__device_address__' with the specific I2C address of your device (see I2C ADDRESSES Section above).

Next, make sure to include an instruction for initializing the I2C Bus for the [Wire](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/tree/master/hardware/arduino/avr/libraries/Wire) Library, as follows:

>There's no need to include the [Wire](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/tree/master/hardware/arduino/avr/libraries/Wire) Library at the top of the sketch as it's already included internally by the MCP3221 Library

```
void setup() {
    Wire.begin();
    // ...other setup code...
}
```

## LIBRARY FUNCTIONS

With the library installed & included in the sketch, and an MCP3221 instance created, the following functions are available (see the usage example sketch for a detailed implementation):

__Note About Methods' Return Values:__  
All 'get' methods return some sort of value (e.g. temp reading, hysteresis setting, etc.), while all 'set' methods return nothing. Nevertheless, ALL methods implicitly update the library's __I2C _comBuffer__ (=communication buffer) after each I2C transmission. The reason for this functional design is to maintain structural coherance between the 'get' and 'set' methods. As 'get' methods cannot return both the desired value and the I2C transmission's result simultaniously. Consequently, if the relevant value hasn't been obtained by a particular 'get' method, the user can simply check the content of the _comBuffer to see what error occured. Similarly, it is possible to check if a particular setting has been successfully applied via a 'set' method either by preforming the corresponding 'get' method - e.g. getHystC() after using setHystC() - or by checking the content of the _comBuffer (0 indicates a successful transmission, 1-6 indicate an error as listed below).
