  MCP3221 LIBRARY - BASIC USAGE EXAMPLE
  -------------------------------------

  INTRODUCTION
  ------------
  This sketch presents a minimal usage example with the MCP3221 Library in which a voltage reading is performed evey 600mS 
  from a 5V input.

                                       -------
                                VCC --| â€¢     |-- SCL
                                      |       |
                                GND --|       |
                                      |       |
                                AIN --|       |-- SDA
                                       -------

  PIN 1 (VCC/VREF) - Serves as both Power Supply input and Voltage Reference for the ADC. Connect to Arduino 5V output or any other
                equivalent power source (5.5V max). If using an external power source, remember to connect all GND's together
  PIN 2 (GND) - connect to Arduino GND
  PIN 3 (AIN) - Connect to Arduino's 3.3V Output or to the middle pin of a 10K potentiometer (the pot's first pin goes to GND and the third to 5V)
  PIN 4 (SDA) - Connect to Arduino's PIN A4 with a 2K2 (400MHz I2C Bus speed) or 10K (100MHz I2C Bus speed) pull-up resistor
  PIN 5 (SCL) - Connect to Arduino's PIN A5 with a 2K2 (400MHz I2C Bus speed) or 10K (100MHz I2C Bus speed) pull-up resistor
  DECOUPING:    Minimal decoupling consists of a 0.1uF Ceramic Capacitor between the VCC & GND PINS. For improved performance,
                add a 1uF and a 10uF Ceramic Capacitors as well across these pins

  I2C ADDRESSES
  -------------
  Each MCP3221 has 1 of 8 possible I2C addresses (factory hardwired & recognized by its specific part number & top marking
  on the package itself):
