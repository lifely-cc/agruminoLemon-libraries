/* 
  MCP3221 LIBRARY - DEVICE INFORMATION STRING EXAMPLE
  ---------------------------------------------------

  INTRODUCTION
  ------------
  This sketch presents a minimal example of extending the MCP3221 Library to include an additional function for generating a printable device
  information string which may be useful, for example, during debugging sessions.

  As can be seen in the sketch below, implementation of this extended functionality only requires adding a single 'include' to the code, namely: 
  to that of the relevant *.h file (i.e. '/utility/MCP3221InfoStr.h').
  
  Note that this functional extension does come at the cost of an increased memory usage, and therefore it seemed preferable to maintain it 
  as an optional add-on rather than include it in the core MCP3221 Library itself.

                                       -------
                                VCC --| â€¢     |-- SCL
                                      |       |
                                GND --|       |
                                      |       |
                                AIN --|       |-- SDA
                                       -------

  PIN 1 (VCC/VREF) - Serves as both Power Supply input and Voltage Reference for the ADC. Connect to Arduino 5V output or any other
                equivalent power source (5.5V max). If using an external power source, remember to connect all GND's together
  PIN 2 (GND) - connect to Arduino GND
  PIN 3 (AIN) - This pin can be left unconnected for the purpose of this sketch
  PIN 4 (SDA) - Connect to Arduino's PIN A4 with a 2K2 (400MHz I2C Bus speed) or 10K (100MHz I2C Bus speed) pull-up resistor
  PIN 5 (SCL) - Connect to Arduino's PIN A5 with a 2K2 (400MHz I2C Bus speed) or 10K (100MHz I2C Bus speed) pull-up resistor
  DECOUPING:    Minimal decoupling consists of a 0.1uF Ceramic Capacitor between the VCC & GND PINS. For improved performance,
                add a 1uF and a 10uF Ceramic Capacitors as well across these pins

  I2C ADDRESSES
  -------------
  Each MCP3221 has 1 of 8 possible I2C addresses (factory hardwired & recognized by its specific part number & top marking
  on the package itself):

      NUMBER             (BIN)      (HEX)     (DEC)     MARKING
